# Hosts File

If you wish to use the HOSTS file, then please download from the following link, to ensure the CDN is used:

### Full Database

Path | Description
------ | ------
[hosts.txt](https://tgc.cloud/downloads/hosts.txt) | Complete HOSTS database

****

### Archived Database - Full & Mobile Database (deprecated)
In the past, HOSTS files were combined with previous versions, and verified (via DNS & CURL) before going live. Once a year, the HOSTS files were purged of all dead domains, to ensure an accurate domain count (and reduce "bulking"). Archived versions of these HOSTS files can be found here:

*Note: the mobile database files were already included in the full database*

Path | Description
------ | ------
[hosts.txt](https://tgc.cloud/downloads/archive/hosts.txt) | Complete HOSTS database (alive and dead)
[hosts.alive.txt](https://tgc.cloud/downloads/archive/hosts.alive.txt) | Domains from `hosts.txt` that resolved and were active (alive)
[hosts.dead.txt](https://tgc.cloud/downloads/archive/hosts.dead.txt) |Domains from `hosts.txt` that no longer resolved and were inactive (dead)
